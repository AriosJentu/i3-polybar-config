# i3-polybar-config
My i3 configuration with Polybar panel.

![Desktop demo](https://github.com/AriosJentu/i3-polybar-config/blob/master/demo.png?raw=true "Desktop demo")
I think it will be better to save my i3wm with Polybar configurations in my own repository.
It looks same for some bars, but I prefer to create this configuration for me.
